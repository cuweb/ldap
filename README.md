# Penguin LDAP

The purpose of this WordPress plugin is to allow users to sign into their WordPress website's backend using LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) with AD (active directory). A probable use for this plugin would be to provide a "single sign on" functionality. This means that users can use the same singular username and password
combination that they use for other services.

##Status

This plugin is still being developed and is under testing in different ldap environments. 

## Installation 
Install like you would any other WordPress plugin.
1. Drop the folder that contains the file Penguin-LDAP.php into `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. In the WordPress backend go to the 'Plugins' section in the nav and find Penguin LDAP Authentication and activate it.
